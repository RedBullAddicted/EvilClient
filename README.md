==========

A python based irc client

TO BE DISCUSSED (Please add whats missing)
==========

1. User Interface (TUI, GUI, webbased) - curses, urwid, QT, TKinter, ?cmd?, ...
2. Multi server support ?
3. Multi channel support -> guess that one is clear but how to realize if there is no gui ? (maybe somehow like irssi does it)
4. client command prefix (. ! --) ?
5. third party libraries allowed ?
6. Basic functionality (think we should focus on the basics first and add fancy stuff later)
7. class, functions, vars naming convention
8. comment style
